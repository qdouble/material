    <md-card-title>FAQ</md-card-title>
    <h6>What type of business or program is this?</h6>

    <p>Level Rewards is a business that promotes incentivized offers. Incentivized offers are promotions in which advertisers
      attract users to sign up for a a trial of their product or service by receiving some type of reward, either directly
      or indirectly. Level Rewards promotes offers that allow for referral reward incentives. This means that users try out
      trials with the incentive that they can receive commission for anyone that they refer afterwards. Referral incentive
      offers typically pay much higher than direct GPT (‘Get Paid To’) offers, which is why Level Rewards promotes referral
      incentive offers instead of direct incentive offers.</p>

    <h6>Is this free?</h6>
    <p>For the most part, yes. Just about all users can sign up and start earning without having to spend any money. There are
      many free offers to try, but there are also many cheap offers that pay out rates that far exceed their cost. Many users
      complete non free offers either because they are genuinely interested in the product/service or because it’s easy and
      will help them earn. Whatever offers users choose to complete, it’s their choice based on what makes sense to them.</p>

    <h6>How can Level Rewards pay out money for free trial sign ups… what’s the catch?</h6>

    <p>Advertisers pay out a lot of money to attract people to sign up to their trials and services. The only obligation our
      users have is to give whatever offer they sign up for a fair try. As long as the majority of our users are trying out
      the offer for 75-90% of the trial period and fully giving the offer a try, the majority of advertisers are happy. If
      the offer is good and users are fully trying the offer, then a natural amount of users may decide to keep the offer
      beyond the trial period.</p>

    <h6>Is this a pyramid scheme or MLM?</h6>

    <p>No. While there is a referral aspect to Level Rewards, the income generated does not come from users spending money.
      Level Rewards does not charge it’s users anything, nor is sales commissions a primary source of revenue. The primary
      source of income in our business is simply lead commissions. Users are not required to pay any monthly fees, they are
      not required to keep trials beyond the trial period and how much a user spends or invests is irrelevant to our business
      model. Getting paid to refer users to try out trials and services is a perfectly legal and legitimate opportunity and
      many major corporations have referral programs.</p>

    <h6>Do I have to use my credit card? Why do even some of the free trials require a credit card?</h6>

    <p>We have offers that users can complete that don’t require a credit card, however, users should not be discouraged from
      trying out those which do require a card. Many free trials require a credit card for 2 reasons: 1) The credit card
      acts as a form of verification, making sure they are getting quality leads. 2) Many advertisers want to make sure there’s
      a straightforward way to convert leads into customers. Using a credit card shows that you may potentially keep the
      offer.</p>

    <h6>How do the levels in Level Rewards work?</h6>

    <p>Level Rewards has easy to complete levels, each worth $5 per referral. The maximum a user can earn per referral is based
      on their level. Every 1.00 credit elevates you to the next level and partial credits are added up. So if you complete an offer 
      worth 1.25 credits, you will be at level 1. If you complete another offer for 0.75 credits, you will have 2.00 credits total and be at level 2.</p>
    <br>
    <p> As an example, if you signup, complete offers and get to level 5, it will enable you to earn up to $25
      per referral. So if you sign someone up and they get to level 1, you’ll earn $5. If you sign up a different user and
      they get to level 3, you will earn $15. If that person comes back and completes 2 more levels, you will earn additional
      $10. If they then go to level 10 and you are still at level 5, you can not get paid out for the levels that they completed
      above your level, until you raise your level.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In reality, a person who gets to level 10 (who can earn up to $50 per referral) will have some users who get to level 5, others who get to level 1, others
      who get to level 10, etc. Increasing your level raises your income potential, but how much you earn per referral will vary.
      Typically, the more you help your referrals and the better relationship you build with them, the more levels they will
      complete and the more you will earn.</p>

    <h6>How long does it take to receive money through PayPal?</h6>

    <p>As soon as your order is approved (typically within 24 hours, but usually much less time than that) it should show up
      within your PayPal account around the same time that it's approved. Sometimes you’ll get paid out within an hour and
      other times it may be several hours, it varies based on when you place your order and when we are processing payments.</p>

    <h6>Who can I sign up?</h6>

    <p>You can sign up any person in an eligible country who is not a member of your household. Only one user can sign up per
      household and only one person can complete offers per IP address. Eligible countries are U.S, Canada, Australia and
      the UK. Users must be at least 18 years of age or older to participate and obtain free items. Persons 16 and 17 years
      may be able to participate if they have parental permission to do so, although they may not be able to complete certain
      offers and may be restricted by any state or local laws.</p>

    <h6>Can I change my sponsor?</h6>
    <p>Level Rewards allows referrals to change sponsor without permission of their original sponsor as long as their current
      sponsor does not have any pending unpaid levels. Quite often, a referral and their sponsor may not know each other
      personally and may not have any communication with each other after initial signup, so we do not see a reason to make
      sponsorship permanent if a referral wants to be switched.</p>

    <h6>I completed an offer, but didn’t receive credit for it. What do I do?</h6>

    <p>As long as the offer doesn’t explicitly state that missing credit requests aren’t allowed, you can file a missing credit
      request. On the support page, click the orange “Click Here to File a Missing Credit” request button. Fill out the form
      on the credit request page to request credit. Be sure to use the email from the advertiser which indicates the you
      fulfilled the offer requirements. Copy and Paste the confirmation email, being sure to include the full headers (https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22454?hl=en).
      In the body section, copy and paste the normal form of the confirmation email.</p>
