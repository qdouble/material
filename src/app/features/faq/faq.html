      <em>What type of business or program is this?</em>
    </h6>

    <p>Level Rewards is a business that promotes incentivized offers. Incentivized offers are promotions in which advertisers
      attract members to sign up for a a trial of their product or service by receiving some type of reward, either directly
      or indirectly. Level Rewards promotes offers that allow for referral reward incentives. This means that members try
      out trials with the incentive that they can receive commission for anyone that they refer afterwards. Referral incentive
      offers typically pay much higher than direct GPT (‘Get Paid To’) offers, which is why Level Rewards promotes referral
      incentive offers instead of direct incentive offers.</p>

    <h6>
      <em>Is this free?</em>
    </h6>
    <p>For the most part, yes. Just about all members can sign up and start earning without having to spend any money. There
      are many free offers to try, but there are also many cheap offers that pay out rates that far exceed their cost. Many
      members complete non free offers either because they are genuinely interested in the product/service or because they
      are easy to complete, the commission rate far exceeds their cost and completing some non free offers may help them
      earn more. Whichever offers our members choose to complete, it’s their choice based on what makes sense to them.</p>

    <h6>
      <em>How can Level Rewards pay out money for free trial sign ups… what’s the catch?</em>
    </h6>

    <p>Advertisers pay out a lot of money to attract people to sign up to their trials and services. The only obligation our
      members have is to give whatever offer they sign up for a fair try. As long as the majority of our members are trying
      out the offer for 90% of the trial period and fully giving the offer a try, the majority of advertisers are happy.
      If the offer is good and members are fully trying the offer, then a natural amount of members may decide to keep the
      offer beyond the trial period.</p>

    <h6>
      <em>Do I have to use my credit card? Why do even some of the free trials require a credit card?</em>
    </h6>

    <p>We have offers that members can complete that don’t require a credit card, however, members should not be discouraged
      from trying out those which do require a card. Many free trials require a credit card for 2 reasons: 1) The credit
      card acts as a form of verification, making sure they are getting quality leads. 2) Many advertisers want to make sure
      there’s a straightforward way to convert leads into customers. Using a credit card shows that you may potentially keep
      the offer. Some free offers may have a $1 authorization hold to test that the card is valid. This is not a cost, as
      the $1 is released within a few business days.</p>

    <h6>
      <em>How do the levels in Level Rewards work?</em>
    </h6>

    <p>Level Rewards has easy to complete levels, each worth $5 per referral. The maximum a member can earn per referral is
      based on their level. Every 1.00 credit elevates you to the next level and partial credits are added up. So if you
      complete an offer worth 1.25 credits, you will be at level 1. If you complete another offer for 0.75 credits, you will
      have 2.00 credits total and be at level 2. If you want to avoid having to do math, you can just click the Add Up Offers
      checkbox on the offers page and click on the offers you want to potentially complete and the system will show you how
      many credits and levels those offers will add up to when completed.</p>
    <br>
    <p> As an example, if you signup, complete offers and get to level 5, it will enable you to earn up to $25 per referral.
      So if you sign someone up and they get to level 1, you’ll earn $5. If you sign up a different member and they get to
      level 3, you will earn $15. If that person comes back and completes 2 more levels, you will earn additional $10. If
      they then go to level 10 and you are still at level 5, you can not get paid out for the levels that they completed
      above your level, until you raise your level.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In reality, a person who gets to level 10 (who can earn up to $50 per referral) will have some members who get to level
      5, others who get to level 1, others who get to level 10, etc. Increasing your level raises your income potential,
      but how much you earn per referral will vary. Typically, the more you help your referrals and the better relationship
      you build with them, the more levels they will complete and the more you will earn.</p>

    <h6>
      <em>How long does it take to receive money through PayPal?</em>
    </h6>

    <p>As soon as your order is approved (typically within 24 hours, but usually much less time than that) it should show up
      within your PayPal account around the same time that it's approved. Sometimes you’ll get paid out within an hour and
      other times it may be several hours, it varies based on when you place your order and when we are processing payments.</p>

    <h6>
      <em>Who can I sign up?</em>
    </h6>

    <p>You can sign up any person in an eligible country who is not a member of your household. Only one member can sign up
      per household and only one person can complete offers per IP address. Eligible countries are U.S, Canada, Australia
      and the UK. Members must be at least 18 years of age or older to participate and obtain free items. Persons 16 and
      17 years may be able to participate if they have parental permission to do so, although they may not be able to complete
      certain offers and may be restricted by any state or local laws.</p>

    <h6>
      <em>Is this a pyramid scheme or MLM?</em>
    </h6>

    <p>No. While there is a referral aspect to Level Rewards, the income generated does not come from members spending money.
      Level Rewards does not charge its members anything, nor is sales commissions a primary source of revenue. The primary
      source of income in our business is simply lead commissions. Members are not required to pay any monthly fees, they
      are not required to keep trials beyond the trial period and how much a member spends or invests is irrelevant to our
      business model. Getting paid to refer members to try out trials and services is a perfectly legal and legitimate opportunity
      and many major corporations have referral programs.</p>

    <h6>
      <em>Can I change my sponsor?</em>
    </h6>
    <p>Level Rewards allows referrals to change sponsor without permission from their original sponsor. Quite often, a referral
      and their sponsor may not know each other personally and may not have any communication with each other after initial
      signup, so we do not see a reason to make sponsorship permanent if a referral wants to be switched. If the referral
      has completed levels before being transferred that are unpaid, we will keep record of it and allow the sponsor to cash
      out on the referrals completed levels providing that neither the referral nor sponsor is on hold, that their credits
      don't get revoked and that the sponsor is at the appropriate level to qualify to receive payment for the referral’s
      completed levels.</p>

    <h6>
      <em>I completed an offer, but didn’t receive credit for it. What do I do?</em>
    </h6>

    <p>As long as the offer doesn’t explicitly state that missing credit requests aren’t allowed, you can file a missing credit
      request. On the support page, click the orange “Click Here to File a Missing Credit” request button. Fill out the form
      on the credit request page to request credit. Be sure to use the email from the advertiser which indicates the you
      fulfilled the offer requirements. Copy and Paste the confirmation email, being sure to include the full headers (
      <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22454?hl=en" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22454?hl=en</a>). In the body section, copy and paste the normal form of the
      confirmation email.</p>
