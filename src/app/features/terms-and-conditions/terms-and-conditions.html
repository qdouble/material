      <strong>II. Sponsor Offers:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You must obtain the required amount of credits by completing offers to be counted as a referral for the person who referred
        you to our Network.
      </li>
      <li>
        You must signup for the offers by clicking on the link provided on the offers page. You are advised to disable popup blocks
        and make sure your browser allows cookies in order to receive credit as well as clear the browser cookies and cache
        before completing any offers.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should not use any type of virtual accounts/cards, prepaid cards, gift cards, rewards cards, or any card that is not
        bank issued to complete offers. If found, your account may be put on hold permanently.
      </li>
      <li>
        We are not responsible for the Terms and Requirements for the Individual offers and are not responsible for any unknown or
        unexpected charges that you receive from one or more of our offers. We strongly suggest that you read the terms and
        conditions of the offer before completing it.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may complete an offer only once. Completing an offer more than once will result in the credit being revoked and your
        account being put on hold.
      </li>
      <li>
        Credited offers can be revoked for the following reasons: 
        1) Not trying out the product or service after completing the offer.
        2) Quick/Immediate cancellation (Not keeping trial for at least 90% of the trial period or a different length if stated in the requirements).
        3) Not abiding by the stated requirements of the offer. 
        4) Using false information. 
        5) Using a prepaid card, gift card, virtual card, lost or stolen card. 
        6) Using a zero balance card or account that declines when the advertiser tries to bill it.
        7) Completing an offer multiple times, whether on our network or on any other network.
        8) Any fraudulent activity done on the advertiser's site or on our site.

      </li>
      <li>
        You should only complete offers that you are interested in and you should not cancel without trying the offer. Completing
        an offer only to get free gifts is considered fraud and you will not receive credit for such offers, and even if
        you did receive credit it will be revoked and your account will be placed on hold.
      </li>
      <li>
        We reserve the right to refuse or revoke credits for offer completions. Reasons for this include but are not limited to,
        duplicate offer completions, fraudulent information, the use of prepaid/virtual/gift/rewards cards, or non-payment
        from the providers.
      </li>
      <li>
        The amount of time taken to get credit for completing an offer varies depending on the offer completed, the advertiser, etc.
        Approximate crediting times are displayed on the offer description.

      <li>
        You must save all confirmation emails received from the affiliate companies.

        the credit yet, you may place a request by going to the support section. Users may not always receive credit for
        completions due to circumstances beyond our control.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We reserve the right to refuse a Missing Credit Request for any of the following reasons:
      </li>

    <ul class="missing-credit">
      <li>
        If the offer explicitly states that it does not accept missing credit requests.

      <li>
        If the offer was completed with invalid information.
      </li>
      <li>

      <li>
        If the offer was completed using a P.O. Box address or Incomplete Address such as missing Apt #.
      </li>

        the offer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Encouraging referrals to game the offers by either trying to use zero balance cards, cancelling early or any other activity
        that results in low quality leads for the advertiser may result in the sponsor and the referrals accounts being placed
        on hold, suspended or banned.
      </li>

        No Walking Through -- A user may not walk a referral through the completion of an offer. All members must sign up for offers
        based on their personal likes and dislikes themselves. If a user is believed to have walked a referral through offer
        process, all involved parties will have their accounts placed on hold.
      </li>
      <li>
        If an interested party has a disability that affects their ability to use our site they may receive assistance, but a support
        ticket describing the situation must be created before an offer is completed.
